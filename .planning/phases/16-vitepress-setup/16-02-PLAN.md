<objective>
Create the landing page and all placeholder content pages for the documentation site, establishing the full page structure that the VitePress navigation and sidebar reference.

Purpose: Complete the documentation site skeleton so all navigation links resolve to real pages, the landing page presents the project professionally, and the site is ready for content writing in Phase 18.

Output: Landing page with hero/features/CTA, 14 placeholder pages across 4 sections, fully navigable VitePress site.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create landing page with hero, feature cards, and CTA buttons</name>
  <files>docs/index.md</files>
  <action>
    Create `docs/index.md` using VitePress home layout frontmatter.

    The landing page must reflect the CONTEXT.md decisions:
    - Audience: genetic counselors AND clinical researchers equally
    - Voice: clinical-first, precise, professional
    - NOT flashy — think VueUse/Pinia docs style

    Frontmatter structure:
    ```yaml
    layout: home

    hero:
      name: gnomAD Carrier Frequency
      text: Calculator for Autosomal Recessive Conditions
      tagline: Calculate carrier frequencies and recurrence risks from gnomAD population data with clinical documentation output
      actions:
        - theme: brand
          text: Open Calculator
          link: /gnomad-carrier-frequency/
        - theme: alt
          text: Getting Started
          link: /guide/getting-started

    features:
      - icon: (pick a suitable emoji like a DNA strand)
        title: gnomAD Integration
        details: Query the Genome Aggregation Database directly from the browser for comprehensive population-level variant data across multiple gnomAD versions
      - icon: (pick a suitable emoji like a chart)
        title: Carrier Frequency Calculation
        details: Calculate carrier frequencies from allele frequencies using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with support for population-specific analysis and founder effect detection
      - icon: (pick a suitable emoji like a document)
        title: Clinical Text Generation
        details: Generate ready-to-use German and English clinical documentation text from customizable templates with support for multiple clinical perspectives
    ```

    EXACTLY 3 feature cards (NOT 4). No Privacy-First card per CONTEXT.md decision.
    The "Open Calculator" link must use the full absolute path `/gnomad-carrier-frequency/` (not relative).
    The "Getting Started" link uses VitePress-relative path `/guide/getting-started`.

    Below the frontmatter, optionally add a brief markdown section (1-2 sentences) introducing the tool. Keep it minimal — the hero and features do the heavy lifting.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `grep -q "layout: home" docs/index.md` confirms home layout
    - `grep -q "Open Calculator" docs/index.md` confirms primary CTA
    - `grep -q "Getting Started" docs/index.md` confirms secondary CTA
    - `grep -c "title:" docs/index.md` returns at least 3 (hero title + 3 feature titles = 4 "title:" lines minimum, but check for feature count)
  </verify>
  <done>Landing page has hero with precise clinical tagline, 3 feature cards (gnomAD Integration, Carrier Frequency Calculation, Clinical Text Generation), and 2 CTA buttons (Open Calculator linking to app, Getting Started linking to guide)</done>

    docs/about/changelog.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Create placeholder markdown pages for each section. Each placeholder should be a real page (not empty) with:
    - A title (h1) matching what the sidebar shows
    - A brief 1-2 sentence description of what the page will contain (content comes in Phase 18)
    - A note like "This page is under construction. Content will be added in a future update."

    **Guide section** (docs/guide/):
    - `index.md` — title "Guide", brief intro to the documentation guide section
    - `getting-started.md` — title "Getting Started", placeholder for step-by-step walkthrough of the calculator

    **Use Cases section** (docs/use-cases/):
    - `index.md` — title "Use Cases", overview of available clinical use case walkthroughs
    - `carrier-screening.md` — title "Carrier Screening Counseling", placeholder for carrier screening scenario
    - `family-planning.md` — title "Recurrence Risk & Family Planning", placeholder for family planning scenario
    - `clinical-letter.md` — title "Clinical Letter Generation", placeholder for clinical documentation scenario

    **Reference section** (docs/reference/):
    - `index.md` — title "Reference", overview of technical reference documentation
    - `methodology.md` — title "Methodology", placeholder for Hardy-Weinberg calculation methodology
    - `data-sources.md` — title "Data Sources", placeholder for gnomAD, ClinVar, ClinGen descriptions
    - `filters.md` — title "Variant Filters", placeholder for filter configuration reference
    - `templates.md` — title "Clinical Text Templates", placeholder for template system reference

    **About section** (docs/about/):
    - `index.md` — title "About", overview of the project
    - `citation.md` — title "Citation", placeholder for CITATION.cff and BibTeX
    - `changelog.md` — title "Changelog", placeholder for version history

    IMPORTANT: Each file must have proper markdown structure (# heading, body text). Do NOT leave files empty — VitePress needs content for search indexing and to avoid rendering warnings.
    IMPORTANT: Do NOT add VitePress frontmatter to these pages (no `---` blocks) unless needed. Plain markdown is fine for content pages.

    After creating all pages, verify the full site works:
    1. Run `npm run docs:build` — should complete with 0 errors
    2. Confirm no dead links in the build output
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `find docs -name "*.md" | wc -l` returns 15 (1 index.md + 14 section pages)
    - `npm run docs:build` completes without errors
    - All sidebar links in config.ts have corresponding .md files
    - `npm run docs:preview` serves the site and all navigation links work (spot-check a few)
  </verify>
  <done>All 15 markdown pages exist (1 landing + 14 section pages), VitePress builds without errors, navigation between all sections works, sidebar shows hierarchical structure, local search indexes all pages</done>
</task>

1. `npm run docs:dev` starts dev server and landing page loads with hero, 3 features, 2 CTAs
2. Clicking Guide, Use Cases, Reference, About in nav bar navigates to each section
3. Sidebar within each section shows hierarchical page list
4. All sidebar links resolve to actual pages (no 404s)
5. `npm run docs:build` completes with 0 errors
6. Theme colors show #a09588 brand color (check link color or button color)
7. Toggling dark mode shows lighter brand color variant
8. Local search returns results when typing a keyword
