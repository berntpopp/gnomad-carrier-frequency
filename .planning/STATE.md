# Project State: gnomAD Carrier Frequency Calculator

---

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** Accurate recurrence risk calculation from gnomAD population data with clinical documentation output
**Current focus:** v1.5 Phase 27 — CLI Package (next)

---

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v1.5 Core Extraction & CLI
**Phase:** 25 of 29 (Monorepo Foundation) — COMPLETE
**Plan:** 5 of 5 in current phase
**Status:** Phase 25 complete, human verification passed
**Last activity:** 2026-02-24 — Phase 25 verified via Playwright (CFTR wizard flow 1:17, 9 populations, clinical text, 0 errors)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

Recent decisions for v1.5:
- Monorepo with bun workspaces (packages/core, packages/cli, apps/web) — core logic reusable across CLI + web + tests
- tsdown v0.20.x for library bundling (tsup successor, pin exact version — pre-1.0)
- Calculation tests written alongside formula changes (not deferred to Phase 29)
- Phase 28 (Gene Configs) depends on Phase 26 (stable calculation API), not Phase 27 (CLI)
- tsdown entry points in packages/core added incrementally as modules are extracted (not declared upfront)
- packages/core tsconfig.json include must be ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.json"] — composite project mode requires JSON files listed explicitly
- vitest `--passWithNoTests` in root script — prevents CI failures before Phase 29 test suite
- export-utils.ts stays in apps/web (uses import.meta.env.VITE_APP_VERSION — Vite-specific, not portable to neutral core)
- variant-display.ts placed in core/filters/ (co-located with variant-filters.ts it imports from)
- Core client (packages/core/src/client/) uses fetch API — platform-neutral, no villus dependency; villus stays only in apps/web/src/api/client.ts
- JSON deep-path imports (@gnomad-cf/core/config/templates/de.json) work via Vite regex alias + tsconfig resolveJsonModule — no separate JSON export needed
- Root typecheck script must use `tsc --build packages/core && bun run --filter gnomad-cf-web typecheck` — plain `tsc --build` fails on .vue files
- GCR uses inclusion-exclusion product (1 - ∏(1-VCRi)), not sum, to avoid double-counting compound heterozygotes (26-01)
- Genetic prevalence always from raw q=SumAF (never derived from carrier frequency 2pq) to avoid compounding approximation errors (26-01)
- formatPrevalence uses en-US locale for thousands separator in ratio format (26-01)
- ac_hom is required (not optional) on all variant interfaces — gnomAD API always returns 0 when no homozygotes, never null (26-02)
- UrlStateSchema lives in @gnomad-cf/core/types (not web-only) — shared core type usable by CLI and web (26-02)
- URL boolean params use '0'/'1' string encoding for consistency with existing conflicting param pattern (26-02)
- aggregatePopulationFrequencies removed; replaced by aggregatePopulationFrequenciesWithConfig — CalcConfig applied once in aggregation (26-03)
- FilterPanel receives calcConfig prop + emits update:calcConfig — store access stays in StepResults, not FilterPanel (26-04)
- Penetrance slider operates in 0-100% integer space in UI; converts to 0-1 fraction before emit (26-04)
- Bayesian prevalence row displayed only when penetrance < 1 (26-04)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 27: gnomAD API rate limits undocumented — default `--concurrency 3` is empirical; make user-configurable

---

## Session Continuity

### Last Session

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Completed:** Phase 25 — all 5 plans executed, human verification passed
**Status:** Phase 25 (Monorepo Foundation) complete. Next: Phase 26 (Calculation Improvements)

### Handoff Notes

v1.5 scope: monorepo extraction, HWE 2pq + homozygote exclusion + genetic prevalence, full CLI, gene configs, comprehensive test suite.

Phase 25 delivered:
- Monorepo structure: packages/core (pure TS), apps/web (Vue 3), packages/cli (stub)
- Core extraction: variant-filters, template-renderer, calculations (carrier frequency, homozygote exclusion, prevalence) all in @gnomad-cf/core
- CLI stub: @gnomad-cf/cli with basic type structure
- Web rewired: all imports use @gnomad-cf/core aliases via tsconfig paths
- CI pipeline: monorepo-aware GitHub Actions with separate core/web build steps
- Documentation: CLAUDE.md updated for monorepo architecture
- Human verification: CFTR wizard flow verified end-to-end via Playwright (1:17 carrier frequency, 9 populations, clinical text, 0 console errors)

Next phases:
- Phase 26 (Calculation Improvements) builds on monorepo foundation
- Phase 27 (CLI Package) depends on Phase 25 ✓
- Phase 28 (Gene Configs) depends on Phase 25 ✓
- Phase 29 (Test Suite) depends on 25, 26, 27, 28
