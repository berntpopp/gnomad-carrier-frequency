# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 15

## Overview

This roadmap delivered a carrier frequency calculator in 4 phases: Foundation established gnomAD API integration and core calculation logic, Wizard UI built the 4-step user interface with population display, German Text added clinical documentation generation, and Deploy validated calculations and published to GitHub Pages.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Establish working gnomAD API integration with multi-version support (v4 default, v3/v2 selectable) and correct carrier frequency calculation logic. All configuration externalized to JSON files - zero hardcoded values.

**Depends on**: None (starting phase)
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Config system (gnomAD versions, settings, thresholds)
- [x] 01-02: Project setup (Vue, Vuetify, TypeScript)
- [x] 01-03: Types, calculation functions, GraphQL client
- [x] 01-04: GraphQL queries and composables
- [x] 01-05: Carrier frequency composable, test UI, version selector

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Multi-version gnomAD support (v4 default, v3 and v2 selectable)
- JSON config files for ALL settings - no hardcoded values
- Browser-only (no Node.js caching patterns)
- DRY, KISS, SOLID principles throughout

**Requirements:** GENE-01, GENE-02, GENE-03, API-01, API-02, API-03, FILT-01, FILT-02, FILT-03, FILT-04, CALC-01, CALC-02, CALC-03, CALC-04, POP-01, POP-02, POP-03, POP-04 (18 total)

### Phase 2: Wizard UI

**Goal**: Users can navigate a complete 4-step wizard flow to calculate carrier frequencies.

**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Wizard types and useWizard composable
- [x] 02-02: Step components (StepGene, StepStatus, StepFrequency)
- [x] 02-03: StepResults, WizardStepper, and App integration

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Linear navigation only (must complete each step before proceeding)
- Frequency source selection via tabs (gnomAD/Literature/Default)
- Status toggle defaults to carrier (heterozygous)
- Sortable results table with v-data-table
- Changing gene resets all downstream steps

**Requirements:** UI-01, UI-02, UI-03, UI-04, IDX-01, IDX-02, SRC-01, SRC-02, SRC-03, SRC-04 (10 total)

---

### Phase 3: German Text

**Goal**: Users can generate and copy German (and English) clinical documentation text with configurable templates.

**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 4 plans (3 core + 1 gap closure)

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Template system foundation (types, renderer, JSON templates)
- [x] 03-02: Pinia store and useTextGenerator composable
- [x] 03-03: TextOutput UI and StepResults integration
- [x] 03-04: Gap closure - affected status granularity + patient sex for German grammar

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Config-driven templates with JSON (German + English)
- Template interpolation: {{gene}}, {{carrierFrequency}}, etc.
- 3 perspectives: affected patient, healthy carrier, family member
- 4 affected statuses: heterozygous, homozygous, compound het confirmed, compound het assumed
- Patient sex selection for German grammatical gender agreement

**Requirements:** TEXT-01, TEXT-02, TEXT-03, TEXT-04 (4 total)

---

### Phase 4: Deploy

**Goal**: Application is validated against known frequencies and deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: CI/Build configuration (ESLint, scripts, base path)
- [x] 04-02: GitHub Actions workflows (CI + Deploy)
- [x] 04-03: Deploy and validation (push, verify, validate calculations)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ESLint 9 flat config with Vue 3 + TypeScript support
- Official GitHub Actions (actions/deploy-pages@v4)
- Separate CI workflow (all branches) and deploy workflow (main only)
- Vite base path configuration for subdirectory deployment

**Requirements:** None (validation only)

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- 4-phase structure: Foundation -> UI -> Text -> Deploy
- Heavy Phase 1 to validate core logic early
- Config-driven thresholds (zero hardcoded values)
- npm over Bun (environment compatibility)
- villus over Apollo (4KB vs 31KB)
- Pinia options API for persistence plugin compatibility
- 4-option IndexPatientStatus for clinical accuracy
- Patient sex selector for German grammatical gender

**Issues Resolved:**
- Phase 3 gap closure: expanded affected status from 2 to 4 options
- Phase 3 gap closure: added patient sex for German grammar

**Tech Debt:**
- Orphaned component: FrequencyResults.vue (superseded by StepResults.vue)
