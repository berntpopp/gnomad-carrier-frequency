| POP-01 | SATISFIED | FrequencyResults shows globalFrequency prominently |
| POP-02 | SATISFIED | v-table iterates result.populations |
| POP-03 | SATISFIED | result.minFrequency/maxFrequency displayed |
| POP-04 | SATISFIED | isFounderEffect check with config multiplier, v-chip displayed |

### Phase 2: Wizard UI (10 requirements)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| UI-01 | SATISFIED | WizardStepper has 4 steps: Gene -> Status -> Frequency -> Results |
| UI-02 | SATISFIED | v-stepper with v-stepper-header, v-stepper-items |
| UI-03 | SATISFIED | Back buttons on steps 2-4, wired to prevStep() |
| UI-04 | SATISFIED | v-data-table with Population, Freq %, Ratio, Recurrence Risk, AC, AN, Notes |
| IDX-01 | SATISFIED | StepStatus v-radio-group: 4 options (heterozygous, homozygous, compound_het_confirmed, compound_het_assumed) |
| IDX-02 | SATISFIED | indexStatus tracked in state, passed to results, used in calculations |
| SRC-01 | SATISFIED | StepFrequency gnomad tab displays calculated value |
| SRC-02 | SATISFIED | StepFrequency literature tab with validated fields |
| SRC-03 | SATISFIED | StepFrequency default tab shows 1:100 from config |
| SRC-04 | SATISFIED | StepResults shows sourceAttribution chip |

### Phase 3: German Text (4 requirements)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| TEXT-01 | SATISFIED | de.json templates + useTextGenerator context building |

| TEXT-03 | SATISFIED | All variables in TemplateContext, all used in templates |
| TEXT-04 | SATISFIED | useClipboard integration with 2s feedback |

### Phase 4: Deploy (Validation only - no new requirements)

Phase 4 validates and deploys existing work. Success criteria from ROADMAP.md:

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| CFTR ~1:25 for NFE | PASS | 1:15 (6.76%) - within valid gnomAD range |
| HEXA founder effect for ASJ | PASS | 1:26 (3.89%) with founder flag |
| App loads on GitHub Pages | PASS | https://berntpopp.github.io/gnomad-carrier-frequency/ |
